For this lab we will be starting to think about analyzing our airplane data. Clean the `Airplane` dataset and recreate a figure similar to lab 2.


```{r, message = F, warning = F}
airplane <- read_csv("Airplane.csv")
```

```{r}
airplane <- airplane %>% 
  mutate(id = 1:n(), feet_dec = -99) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Dart,Glider))
```
